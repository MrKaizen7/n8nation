TL;DR

This Repo allows you to not have to remind your copilot that i.e. the component name is PalmTree and not palmtree, sounds famiiar?

The Instructions work on a deeper level compared to context, your copilot will check the instructions first and he'd be smart to know which ones to use.

The Prompts are merely presets, handy when you have repetitive tasks that involve preserving a structure/style, and helps the copilot save a few 'wait, what is life?' moments.

This folder powers the AI-driven development engine for the repository. It provides modular instructions and reusable prompts for both human collaborators and AI, ensuring consistent standards, workflows, and onboarding processes.

## Global Purpose
This AI instruction engine is designed to be a centralized entry point for n8nation members. Its goal is to facilitate collaboration between humans and AI agents, ensuring all contributors follow consistent standards and leverage best practices in automated workflow development.

## Template Activation
- Templates are located in the `_.github_template` folder.
- To activate them, rename the `_.github_template` folder to `.github`. This will make the configurations and instructions automatically recognized by the repository.

## Structure
- `copilot-instructions.md`: Main template for AI agents (project overview, key patterns, workflows).
- `instructions/`: Modular files for language, framework, and feature-specific standards.
- `prompts/`: Prompt files for tasks such as code generation, review, and structure creation.

## Usage
- **Instructions**: Navigate to the `instructions/` folder to consult language, framework, or feature-specific standards.
- **Generate Instructions**: Use the files in `prompts/` to generate task-specific instructions like code generation or review.

## Extension
- Add new instruction or prompt files as the project evolves.
- Reference instruction files from prompts to avoid duplication.
- Document changes in the changelog and roadmap.

For more details, see `AI_INSTRUCTION_ENGINE_TEMPLATE.md` in this folder.

## The n8nation Ecosystem

This repository is a quick entry point, the full **n8nation** project is a broader ecosystem that includes an advanced AI Copilot, a React app, databases, and a collaborative business strategy.

Development of the n8nation ecosystem will take place in a **dedicated repository** (coming soon), where you'll find the full implementation and all the tools to build, collaborate, and monetize with n8n.
