# .github AI Instruction Engine

This folder powers the AI-driven development engine for the repository. It provides modular instructions and reusable prompts for both human and AI contributors, ensuring consistent standards, workflows, and onboarding.

## Structure
- `copilot-instructions.md`: Main guide for AI agents (project overview, key patterns, workflows)
- `instructions/`: Modular files for language, framework, and feature-specific standards
- `prompts/`: Task-specific prompt files for code generation, review, and scaffolding

## Usage
- New contributors and AI agents should start here to understand project standards and workflows.
- All instructions and prompts are kept up-to-date with codebase changes.
- See the main repo README for project context; see this folder for implementation details.

## Extending
- Add new instruction or prompt files as the project evolves.
- Reference instruction files from prompts to avoid duplication.
- Document changes in the changelog and roadmap.

For more details, see `AI_INSTRUCTION_ENGINE_TEMPLATE.md` in this folder.
